The water cycle is the process by which water circulates between the earth's oceans, atmosphere, and land. It involves several stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. During evaporation, water from oceans, rivers, and lakes turns into water vapor and rises into the atmosphere. Condensation occurs when the water vapor cools and forms clouds. Precipitation is when water falls from clouds as rain, snow, or hail. Finally, water collects back into bodies of water, completing the cycle.
